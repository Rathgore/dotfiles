Installation
------------

Clone the repo then symlink any files you want to use to the appropriate
path. For example, to use my zshrc file do something like:

    ln -s ~/dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc

Because Git rules, you can make your own changes to this file in a local
branch and then rebase on top of my changes.
